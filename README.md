# car parking real-Time Detection System
This project is a real-time car parking detection system powered by computer vision techniques. It helps identify and monitor available and occupied parking spaces using video feeds from CCTV cameras or live streams. The system is designed for smart city infrastructure and efficient parking management.

## Features

- Real-time detection of available and occupied parking spots.
- Works with both live camera feeds and pre-recorded videos.
- Compatible with various parking layouts.
- High accuracy with robust deep learning models.

## How It Works
1. Input:

A video feed from a camera overlooking a parking area.
2. Processing:

Object Detection: Detects vehicles in the parking area.
Space Monitoring: Identifies vacant and occupied parking spots based on vehicle locations.
3. Output:
